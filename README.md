# HOW TO RUN THE APP
# 1. Download the repository from GitHub
# 2. It the project's root directory, run the following commands in Bash (or CMDER)
    -> python -m venv venv 
    -> .\venv\Scripts\activate
# 3. Next, make sure you have the "Requirements.txt" file in your root directory. This file holds the required dependencies for the project to work. Run the following command: 
    -> pip install -r requirements.txt
# 4. The app is now ready to run. Run it using the command:
    -> python app.py
# 5. If you already have a list of users in your SQLite database, copy the .db file to the root and name it "project_tracker.db". If you are are running the app for the first time, you can create a new list of users in the application that will save to this file.
